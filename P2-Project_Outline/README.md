## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In the world of home/personal gaming, the ability to track and share scores and achievements on 
stand-up communal games at bars and arcades has been allocated to simply remembering them, 
revisiting the venue or arcade, or through "word of mouth". With the resurgence of the 
popularity of "old school" arcade-style gaming, coupled with a scarcity of certain games, there 
is a need for players to record all the pertinent information about their experience with the 
game, such as scores, where the game was found, and their thoughts on the experience.
 
For this project, I will create an app which allows a user to track the names of pinball 
machines that he/she/they have played from a known pinball database and record the scores 
achieved on those specific games. The user will also be able to input the location of the 
pinball machine, which will be available to other users searching for a specific machine in 
their area. The user will be able to leave feedback on their experience and rate the games 
replay ability.

### Features
1. User login- users can create unique accounts with username and password
2. Search- users will be able to search for specific pinball machines by name
3. Record scores/achievements- users can record/track personal scores for each game
4. Share- users can share scores with other users via leaderboard

### Technologies
1. Java
2. MySQL
3. Hibernate
4. Thymeleaf templates
5. Spring Boot

### What I'll Have to Learn
1. Importing data from public API (i.e. pinball database)
2. Possible animation for home screen leaderboard
3. Creating function to search new database of locations of games
